# A Coder with a passion 🔥, I'm Arfat

As a computer science student at FAST Islamabad, I've spent most of my time in front of a computer 💻.

I've been coding for a while now and love to work on tech projects 💻. I have developed my blogs and other personal projects, as well as worked as a web developer for REX MEDIA GROUP 💼. 

One of my favorite projects is a web scrapper written in Python that scrapes and downloads movies from YTS.io 🎥. It's like having my own personal Netflix, but I don't have to share with anyone else!
